Existing Solutions 

Data Processing, Data Analysis and Data Visualization well explained: 
•	Just for understanding the Project better - with Tensorflow:  https://www.kaggle.com/code/dschettler8845/uwm-gi-tract-image-segmentation-eda 

Existing Solutions (Code): 
•	UNET - well explained: https://www.kaggle.com/code/awsaf49/uwmgi-unet-train-pytorch - public score 0.842 
•	UNET 2.5D - well explained: https://www.kaggle.com/code/awsaf49/uwmgi-2-5d-train-pytorch - public score 0.862
•	3rd Place Winner - not well explained https://www.kaggle.com/code/hesene/3rd-place-winning-solution - public score 0.89
•	DeepLabV3+  - Tensorflow: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dschettler8845/uwmgit-deeplabv3-end-to-end-pipeline-tf - public score 0.DeepLabV3+  - Tensorflow: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dschettler8845/uwmgit-deeplabv3-end-to-end-pipeline-tf - public score 0.81

Our Code Base for Enhancements: 
•	Suggestion from Javier: 3rd Place Winner Solution -> runs successfully
•	Alternative: UNET 2.5D -> very good explained - needs time to get running.

Most Used Models
•	Unet: (2D and 2.5D Model) 
•	Monai (3D Model) 
•	DeepLabV3+
•	DeeplabV3

-> Different Approaches: 
•	2D
•	2.5D
•	3D

Questions to Javier: 
- Project Plan ok? 
- Papers


Yaseen:
Drawbacks from current model. 
Ambiguity for hyperparameters, not specified as model uses different pretrained models. To make changes in that model we will have to delve deeper into 10 or so pretrained models with pre initialized weights and hyperparameters. 
Code difficult to implement if wamtedto make any changes.
