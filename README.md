# 3. Our Code 
## About the Code Base - What changes we had to do?  


## What did we change and try? 


## What other possible solutions could be tried? 
















Yaseen:
Drawbacks from current model. 
Ambiguity for hyperparameters, not specified as model uses different pretrained models. To make changes in that model we will have to delve deeper into 10 or so pretrained models with pre initialized weights and hyperparameters. 
Code difficult to implement if wamtedto make any changes.
